- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a computational physicist and a materials chemist.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in molecules and materials.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring materials and molecules for energy applications using QM, tight-binding, and ML techniques.
- I love Modern Fortran + Python, C, and a bit of C++.
